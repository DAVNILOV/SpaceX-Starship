# SpaceX-Starship

In this spaceman game, you will get to test your aerospace terminology. You have a few tries to guess the correct word. If you guess six incorrect letters, the starship will be built and you will fly to Mars and the game will be over. You need to guess the correct word before the starship is built, and your goal is to stay here on earth.
